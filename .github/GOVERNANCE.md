# Fountain Coach Governance

## Purpose
This repository defines the governance, style, and release principles of the Fountain Coach organization.

### FCIS-VRT Quadrupel Rhythm
| State | Git Equivalent | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Commit** | Drift Frame | Active change |
| **Tag** | Baseline Frame | Stable reference |
| **Release** | Quiet Frame | Reproducible state |
| **Snapshot** | Archive Frame | Permanent record |

### Branching and Releases
- Feature branches: `feature/<topic>`  
- Baseline tags: `B-<version>`  
- Quiet releases: `Q-<version>`  
- Archive snapshots: `A-<version>`

### Decision Making
- Changes must pass review by at least one maintainer from another repository layer.
- Merges require a Quiet Frame alignment test via FCIS-VRT (VRT-Render or VRT-Protocol as declared by the repo).

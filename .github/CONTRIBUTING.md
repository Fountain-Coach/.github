# Contributing to Fountain Coach

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Fountain Coach organization!

### Core Principles
- **Quiet-frame documentation style:** concise, calm, and consistent.
- **Swift 6 concurrency:** use actors, `Sendable`, and structured concurrency.
- **PB-VRT integrity:** ensure every change can be visually or semantically diffed.

### Workflow
1. Fork and branch from `main`.
2. Commit changes (each commit = Drift Frame).
3. Open a Pull Request using the template provided.
4. Tag reviewed states with a Baseline (B-Tag).
